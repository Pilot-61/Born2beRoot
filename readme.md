### Preamble
This document is a System Administration related exercise focusing on virtualization. It guides participants through setting up a secure operating system following specific guidelines.

### Introduction
The project aims to introduce participants to the world of virtualization by creating and configuring a server. VirtualBox or UTM is used to implement specific rules and guidelines.

### General Guidelines
- **Mandatory Use of VirtualBox or UTM:** Participants must use these tools for virtualization.
- **Submission:** Only a signature.txt file containing the virtual disk's signature is required.
- *Refer to the Submission and peer-evaluation section for detailed submission instructions.*

### Mandatory Part
Participants must:
- Set up a server with minimum services, devoid of a graphical interface.
- Choose Debian or Rocky as the operating system.
- Configure encryption using LVM.
- Establish strict security measures including SSH access, firewall setup, strong password policies, sudo configuration, and a monitoring script.
- **Refer to Chapter IV for detailed mandatory requirements.**

### Bonus Part
Additional tasks include:
